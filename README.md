Here are some python projects i have created.

1) Object Detection -This project on object detection using OpenCV,It leverages the power of deep learning to accurately identify and locate objects within images.Used
  üîç Model is SSD MobileNetV3 (Single Shot Multibox Detector)üì¶ Pre-trained Model Files are Model Weights: frozen_inference_graph.pb and Model Configuration: ssd_mobilenet_v3_large_coco_2020_01_04.pbtxt
   and üñ•Ô∏è Code Components are Main Script: main.py and Detection Module: Detector.py
   
3) Voice chatbot - Made voice chatbot using speech recognition and pyttsx3 library.The `speech_recognition` library in Python provides tools for capturing and processing speech, enabling the conversion of spoken        language into text using various speech recognition engines. The `pyttsx3` module is a text-to-speech conversion library that allows Python programs to convert text into spoken words using offline speech     
   synthesis. Both libraries are commonly used in applications involving voice commands and automated speech responses.
