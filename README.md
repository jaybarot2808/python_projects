Here is some python projects i created.

1) Voice chatbot - Made voice chatbot using speech recognition and pyttsx3 library.The `speech_recognition` library in Python provides tools for capturing and processing speech, enabling the conversion of spoken language into text using various speech recognition engines. The `pyttsx3` module is a text-to-speech conversion library that allows Python programs to convert text into spoken words using offline speech synthesis. Both libraries are commonly used in applications involving voice commands and automated speech responses.

2) Object Detection -This project on object detection using OpenCV,It leverages the power of deep learning to accurately identify and locate objects within images.
